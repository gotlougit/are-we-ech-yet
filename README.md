# Are We ECH Yet?

This is a small static website which just checks the top 1000 websites for ECH support.
You can use the web portal to search for a particular domain. 

Alternatively, the `results` text file contains a domain and a number. 1 indicates there is NO ECH
support on that domain, 0 indicates that ECH is set up.

## Contributing

To add a new website to check for, simply open a pull request. In the future we may migrate
to use a database instead, but for a simple experiment, this will do fine for now.
