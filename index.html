    <!-- Collapsible Explanation of ECH -->
    <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleExplanation()">What is ECH, and why is it important?</button>
    <div class="content" id="explanation">
        <p>Disclaimer: some of this is simplified for brevity</p>
        <p>ECH, short for Encrypted Client Hello, is an extension to TLS 1.3, the latest
encryption protocol that helps secure HTTPS connections (website connections but also increasingly more, like WebSockets etc).
It helps obfuscate what domain name you are requesting.</p>

        <p>Before HTTPS, there was HTTP, and HTTP was completely unencrypted. That means
        on its way from your machine to the server where the website you requested is hosted,
        literally any intermediary can view what you are reading, writing, watching etc and also modify it. This was used, for example, in
        mass government surveillance techniques as well as [Internet Service Providers injecting their own advertisements in HTTP pages](https://superuser.com/questions/902635/isp-is-inserting-ads-into-web-pages)</p>

        <p>After the Snowden revelations, work was accelerated to shift everyone to HTTPS, which uses the TLS protocol to encrypt
        HTTP connections (among other changes). This meant nobody other than the server and the client can view the page (assuming nobody has broken encryption).
        However, in order to bootstrap an encrypted connection, we needed the domain to be in plaintext. 
        (For a more thorough explanation why, go through [this blogpost](https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-client-hello/))</p>

        <p>This means, for example, that before HTTPS, someone could see that you are viewing a particular YouTube video,
        but after HTTPS, they could only view that you visited youtube.com and exchanged an awful lot of data with the server.
        While the amount of data exposed is less, the metadata remaining is still damning. 
        (Imagine someone seeing in logs that you visited WhatsApp, then simultaneously browsed 
        Google and then a series of hospitals' websites, WebMD, and a banking website. Even with this 
        little information you can take a good guess at what is happening)</p>

        <p>With ECH, this is now no longer the case. Thanks to other technologies such as DNS over HTTPS
        (which makes sure that your DNS requests aren't being tampered with by a third party), we can now encrypt this domain name
        and instead expose a more general domain name that usually corresponds to whatever CDN or hosting platform that website is using.
        In other words, rather than seeing "youtube.com", the passive observer will see "generic-cdn-domain.com", so the observer can inference
        that you are visiting a Google-hosted property, but not which one.</p>

        <p>However, this does require that the server support ECH, and since it is a very new feature,
        it is unlikely to be adopted very soon. However, this website is created to keep track of which websites
        have it yet</p>
